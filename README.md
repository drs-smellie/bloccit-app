# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development skills.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.

## Setup
Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
